## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.


Flexbox is a layout system that is for organizing elements in either a horizontal row or a vertical column. It's great for tasks like centering items, distributing space between them, and handling flexible sizing. However, it's not optimized for creating intricate grid structures or managing content in both horizontal and vertical directions simultaneously.


2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

- The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are arranged. This axis can be either horizontal or vertical.

- The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. It runs at a right angle to the main axis. So, if the main axis is horizontal, the cross axis is vertical, and vice versa.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?


You need to be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, as it can negatively impact accessibility. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

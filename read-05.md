# Readings: Images, Color, Text

## Why does this topic matter? 

These topics matter if you want to create something pretty for the user to look at. With out CSS, your page would be very bland. You also want to make sure your webpage is accessible so everyone can enjoy what you created.

## HTML Media

1. **What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**

    The alt atribute is used to provide alternative text for an image. It is used for:
    - Accessibility
    - Broken Images
    - Non-Visual Browsers
    - Slow internet
    - Legal Compliance


2. **How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**
  
    Improving the accessibility of images is to make sure that all users can understand and interact with the content. Here are some examples:

    - Use descriptive alt text
    - Use captions and labels


3. **Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**

    Figure is used to group photos together. So if you have multiple photos of cats that you want to share, you can use figure to specify a specific cat with some information about it.

4. **Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**

    gif images are a good choice for simple images and animations. Svg images are ideal for user interface elements, icons, digrams, etc.

5. **What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**

    You should use a lossless format for screenshots. This is particularly important if there's any text in your screenshot, as text easily becomes fuzzy and unclear under lossy compression
    
    You can use PNG or JPEG as a fallback if needed.

## Learn CSS

1. **Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**

    The foreground is the color of the text or content that you see on a webpage. For example, if you're reading black text on a white page, the black color is the foreground color.

    The background is the color that surrounds the content. If you imagine a webstie, it's the color you'd see behind everything else.

2. **Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**

    I would apply color to the headers and text. I would change the background color. I would also add some color to borders and nav bar.

3. **What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**

    You should think about all users who are coming to your site. You should consider readability, accessibility, fonts, colors, font style when deciding.

4. **What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?**

- font-size: controls how big or small the text appears. 
- font-weight: this determines how thick or bold you want your text to look.
- font-style: this lets you change the style of the text. 

5. **Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**

    You can use padding and margin. Padding will create space between the content and the border. Margin creates space around the entire element.

## Why this topic matters

- It's important to help us become more effecient developers. 

## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

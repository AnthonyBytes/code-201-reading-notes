## Why do these topics matter?

Creating links is very important for any website, so it is important to understand how to link properly. Also, accessibility is something that we all need to take into account when writing our code, so understanding ways that we can make things more accessible is very important.

## Learn HTML

1. **To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

We wrap in an anchor tag: < a > < /a >

2. **The href attribute contains what information?**

It contains the URL of the link. It tells the browser where to navigate when the user clicks on the link.

3. **What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

- Use clear link wording
- Don't use URLs as part of the link text
- Keep link text short

## CSS Layout

1. **What is meant by “normal flow”?**

Elements on a webpage lay out in normal flow if you haven't applied any CSS to change the way they behave. 

2. **What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**

- Block-level elements fill the available inline space of the parent element containing it, growing along the block dimension to accommodate its content.

- Inline elements are just the size of their content. You can set width or height on some elements that have a default display property value of inline.


3. **___ positioning is the default for every html element.**

Static

4. **Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

- Precise Placement
- Z-index
- Layering
- Fined-tuned alignment

5. **What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

- Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
- Fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.


## Learn JS

1. **Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**

- A function declaration is a statement that defines a new function in JavaScript. 
- A function invocation is when you use a defined function by its name to perform a specific task or computation.

2. **What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

- A parameter is a variable in a function's definition. It's a placeholder for a value that the function expects to receive when it is called.
- An argument is an actual value or expression that is passed to a function when it is called.

## Miscellaneous

1. **Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

- Learning from fellow students. This one is perfect for learning about different ways to code things. You also may feel more comfortable to communicate with fellow students since there is the mutual understanding of learning.
- Greater efficiency. When you work together you get things done quicker. Just in the first few days of working on code by myself, I already understand the benefits of working together with someon on a coding project and how much time that can save.  


## Things I want to know more about

I want to continue working on arrays and if statements to get a strong understanding on how it all works. I also would like to learn more about functions, but I am sure this is coming very soon.

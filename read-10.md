# Readings: Debugging

## why this topic matters

- This topic is important because there will always be bugs in your code and you need to know how to look and find them. 

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.


Syntax errors are usually spelling errors in your code, where logic errors usually occur becasue the code is not what you intended it to be. When debugging, syntax errors are usually easier to identify and fix over logic errors. 


2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.


I've had lots of errors over my past lab times, both syntax and logic related. I usually look through my code for syntax errors, then I will start looking at the logic. If I cannot figure it out, I usually ask my good friend chatgpt to check my code for errors and it usually figures it out. 


3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?


I will definitely start checking my code more often for errors. Instead of writing full code, maybe just stop every few lines to make sure everything is working as intended. 


## The JavaScript Debugger.

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?


The JavaScript Debugger tool is a feature provided by web browsers to help developers find and fix bugs and errors. It allows you to inspect the state of your code at various points, making it easier to understand how your code is running and identify areas that need improvement.


2. Define what a breakpoint is.


Breakpoints are places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly. 


3. What is the call stack?


The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
